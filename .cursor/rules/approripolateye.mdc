# 📐 Approripolateye Workflow Rule

This rule guarantees steady, controlled progress:

1. **Plan First** – Every change starts with a Markdown plan in `DEV_MAN/plans/current/`.  No code before plan approval.
2. **One Branch per Plan** – Create a single branch named `<type>/<short-desc>` dedicated to that plan.  Do not mix tasks.
3. **One PR per Branch** – Open a PR that links back to its plan (`Closes #<issue>` or plan filename).
4. **CI / Push Protection** – PR must pass tests, lint, and secret scanning before merge.
5. **Plan Archival** – Immediately after merge, move the plan to `plans/completed/` with `chore/plan-housekeeping` branch.
6. **Sequential Work** – Begin the next plan only after the previous branch is merged.

Following this rule ensures clear history, easy code reviews, and eliminates cross-task conflicts.
