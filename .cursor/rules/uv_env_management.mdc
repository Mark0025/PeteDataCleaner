# uv Environment Management

- Always use `uv python ...` to run scripts if you want to use the uv-managed environment.
- If using an IDE, set the Python interpreter to `.venv/bin/python` in your project root.
- Never mix system Python and uv `.venv` for the same project.
- When switching between projects, always check which environment is active with `which python` or `python --version`.
- If you install packages with `uv add ...`, they are only available in the uv `.venv`.
- Document any environment-specific issues in DEV_MAN/logs for future reference.
