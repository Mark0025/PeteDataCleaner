**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-09

**Priority:** High

## üéØ Goal

Enhance the Owner Objects to include comprehensive phone data so the dashboard can show:

- **All phone numbers** with their **status**, **tags**, and **types**
- **Clear identification** of which phones are prioritized for Pete
- **LLC ownership** detection and phone analysis
- **Skip trace opportunities** with phone quality indicators

## üìä Current Data Structure

### **Original Data (What We Have):**

```
Phone 1, Phone Type 1, Phone Status 1, Phone Tags 1
Phone 2, Phone Type 2, Phone Status 2, Phone Tags 2
...
Phone 30, Phone Type 30, Phone Status 30, Phone Tags 30
```

### **Enhanced Data (What We Have):**

```
Phone 1, Phone 2, Phone 3, Phone 4 (prioritized for Pete)
Owner Type, Property Address, Mailing Address
```

### **Owner Objects (What We Have):**

```
individual_name, business_name, mailing_address, property_address
is_individual_owner, is_business_owner, confidence_score
total_property_value, property_count, skip_trace_target
```

## üîß Enhanced Solution

    mailing_address: str = ""
    property_address: str = ""
    is_individual_owner: bool = False
    is_business_owner: bool = False
    has_skip_trace_info: bool = False
    total_property_value: float = 0.0
    property_count: int = 0
    property_addresses: List[str] = None
    skip_trace_target: str = ""
    confidence_score: float = 0.0
    seller1_name: str = ""

    # NEW: Enhanced phone data
    all_phones: List[PhoneData] = None
    pete_prioritized_phones: List[PhoneData] = None
    phone_quality_score: float = 0.0
    best_contact_method: str = ""

    # NEW: Property portfolio details
    property_details: List[PropertyDetail] = None
    llc_analysis: Dict[str, Any] = None

@dataclass
class PhoneData:

    number: str = ""
    original_column: str = ""  # "Phone 1", "Phone 2", etc.
    status: str = ""           # "CORRECT", "WRONG", "DEAD", etc.
    phone_type: str = ""       # "MOBILE", "LANDLINE", "UNKNOWN"
    tags: str = ""             # "call_a01", "call_a02", etc.
    priority_score: float = 0.0
    is_pete_prioritized: bool = False
    confidence: float = 0.0

@dataclass
class PropertyDetail:
    """Detailed property information."""
    property_address: str = ""
    mailing_address: str = ""
    owner_name: str = ""
    owner_type: str = ""       # "Individual", "LLC", "Corporation"
