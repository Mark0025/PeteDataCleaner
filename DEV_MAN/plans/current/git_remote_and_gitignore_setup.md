## 🎯 Goal & Scope

Craft and commit a project-specific `.gitignore`, configure the new GitHub remote, rename branch to `main`, push initial history, and verify remote linkage.

---

## ✅ Sequential Steps

- [x] 1. Draft the `.gitignore` content.
- [x] 2. Add the `.gitignore` file (`git add .gitignore`).
- [x] 3. Commit with message `chore: add project-specific .gitignore`.
- [x] 4. Set remote `origin` → `https://github.com/Mark0025/PeteDataCleaner.git`.
- [x] 5. Ensure branch is `main` (`git branch -M main`).
- [x] 6. Push to remote & set upstream (`git push -u origin main`).
- [x] 7. Verify remote push (`git remote show origin`).
- [x] 8. Update plan with results & mark complete.

## 🔍 Execution Results

- `.gitignore` created with rules for Python artifacts, virtualenv, UV lock files, logs, datasets, IDE configs, etc.
- Commit `9913250 chore: add project-specific .gitignore` added to history.
- Remote `origin` now points to `https://github.com/Mark0025/PeteDataCleaner.git`.
- Branch `main` set and pushed; tracking established.
- Remote verification confirms `main` is up-to-date and tracking `origin/main`.
