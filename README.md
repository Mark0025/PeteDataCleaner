# 🧩 **How the App Works: High-Level Overview**

## 1. **Rule Management & Automation (DEV_MAN/rules_fetcher)**
- **Purpose:** Automate discovery, fetching, standardization, and integration of Cursor rules from the awesome-cursorrules repo.
- **Key Utilities:**
  - `fetch_and_save_rules.py`, `readme_parser.py`: Fetch rules by name from GitHub.
  - `compare_rules.py`: Compare rules for overlap/contradiction.
  - `standardize_rules.py`, `auto_update_descriptions.py`: Ensure rules have modern headers, descriptions, and globs.
  - `move_approved_rules.py`: Move approved rules into `.cursor/rules/` for project-wide use.
- **Reports:** All actions and comparisons are logged in markdown reports in `DEV_MAN/`.

## 2. **Planning & Documentation (DEV_MAN/plans)**
- **Purpose:** Enforce a plan-first, versioned, changelog-driven workflow for all features and utilities.
- **How:** Every new feature/utility starts with a plan in `plans/current/`, with checkboxes, Mermaid diagrams, changelogs, and rationale.
- **Status:** Plans are moved to completed when done; all progress/issues are logged.

## 3. **Backend (backend/)**
- **sheets_client.py:**  
  - Scaffolds a modular Google Sheets API client.
  - Supports setting a sheet ID, fetching sheet names, headers, and data.
  - All actions are logged to `DEV_MAN/backend.log` using `loguru`.
  - **Current state:** Placeholder logic; real Google Sheets API integration is not yet implemented.

## 4. **Frontend (Planned, Not Yet Implemented)**
- **Goal:** Streamlit-based UI for Google Sheets interaction, data viewing, and analysis.
- **Status:** Planned in `PENDING_PLANS/adding_streamlitv1.md`, not yet built.

## 5. **Google Apps Script Integration**
- **Files:** `gas_code.js`, `update_gas.py`, `run_gas_function.py`
- **Purpose:** Automate Google Apps Script deployment and function execution for Google Sheets workflows.
- **Status:** Scripts exist, but are not yet tightly integrated with the new backend/frontend workflow.

## 6. **Other**
- **addresformater/**: Contains JSON schema and templates, likely for address formatting/validation.
- **hello.py**: Simple hello world script.
- **config.py**: Contains Google API scopes.

# ✅ **What the App Can Do**

- **Automate rule management:** Fetch, standardize, compare, and move Cursor rules for project-wide use.
- **Enforce planning discipline:** All features/utilities are planned, versioned, and logged before implementation.
- **Scaffold backend logic:** Modular, loguru-logged backend for Google Sheets access (ready for real API integration).
- **Generate reports:** Markdown reports for rule comparison, standardization, and moves.
- **Prepare for Streamlit UI:** All planning and backend scaffolding is in place for a future frontend.

---

# ❌ **What the App Cannot Do (Yet)**

- **No real Google Sheets API integration:**  
  - `backend/sheets_client.py` is scaffolded but does not connect to Google Sheets.
- **No working Streamlit UI:**  
  - Frontend is planned but not implemented.
- **No end-to-end workflow:**  
  - No UI-to-backend-to-Sheets data flow yet.
- **No direct data analysis or visualization:**  
  - Analysis logic is planned but not built.
- **No user authentication or security:**  
  - No auth for backend/frontend or Google API.
- **No CI/CD or deployment automation:**  
  - Not yet set up for automated deployment or testing.

---

# 🔗 **How Everything Connects**

- **Rule fetcher utilities** automate the curation and integration of best-practice rules, which are then used by the AI agent and enforced in all planning and coding.
- **Planning system** ensures every new feature/utility is documented, versioned, and reviewed before any code is written.
- **Backend client** (once implemented) will power both the Streamlit UI and any analysis/automation scripts.
- **All logs and reports** are centralized in `DEV_MAN/` for easy review and traceability.

---

# 🟡 **Where the App is Lacking / Next Steps**

- **Backend:** Needs real Google Sheets API integration in `sheets_client.py`.
- **Frontend:** Needs Streamlit UI implementation and connection to backend.
- **End-to-end flow:** Needs wiring up of UI, backend, and Google Sheets for real user workflows.
- **Testing:** Needs automated tests for backend and utilities.
- **Docs:** README and user/developer documentation are minimal or missing.
- **Security:** Needs user authentication and API key management for production use.
